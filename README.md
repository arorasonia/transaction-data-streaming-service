# Transaction Data Streaming Service

This is a high-performance, real-time transaction data streaming service designed to process and manage transaction events for financial systems. The service provides real-time streaming of transaction data, making it suitable for applications such as fraud detection, financial reporting, or transaction analytics.

## Features

- Real-time transaction data streaming.
- High throughput and low latency processing.
- Supports various formats like JSON for transaction data.
- Integrates with Apache Kafka for message streaming.
- Configurable for different transaction sources (e.g., credit card, online banking).
- Scalable to handle large volumes of transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Main framework for building the service.
- **Apache Kafka**: For real-time message streaming.
- **Java**: Programming language used to implement the service.
- **SLF4J with Logback**: For logging.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build tool.

## Architecture

The system uses Kafka to stream transaction data from producers (such as payment gateways or banking systems) to consumers (such as fraud detection systems, analytics platforms, etc.). 

1. **Producer**: The application that generates transaction data and publishes it to Kafka topics.
2. **Kafka Broker**: The central component that receives, stores, and distributes messages.
3. **Consumer**: Application services that consume data from Kafka topics for processing, storage, or analysis.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher.
- Apache Kafka (or use a Kafka service like Confluent Cloud).
- Maven.
